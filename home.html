        <h2><p>Startup of our choice--<a style="color: black; font-weight: bold;" href="https://www.teamgather.co/">Gather</a>--helps people and team coordinate with smart & automated communication by deep integration with Slack, so employees could connect with each other more easily with more streamlined message sending based on special events such as onboarding/offboarding, work anniversary, birthdays, etc. </p></h2>
        <h2>For Gather, we are designing an application that is suitable for desktop manipulation, since our target audience would be office workers who need to be on their computer to monitor and manage their working progress.
          We believe that those who work in large company and have complicated projects that need collaboration between departments would benefit a lot from this app, especially due to the large amoung of functionalities the app provides as well as a strong slack integration.

        <h2 style="font-weight: bolder;"><u>Design Principles & Inspirations</u></h2>
        <h2>In our design, we wish that the main functionalities be centered around two modules--workspace & personal dashboard. </h2>
        <h2>Workspace: forming connections with company employees, automated slack message management system, team collaboration on projects. </h2>
        <h2>Personal dashboard focuses on sorting out personal tasks and duties from workspace. </h2>
        <h2>To release stress in the workplace, we want to use color palettes with low saturation colors, but have primary colors to highlight important messages. Increase organization and tidiness of layout, use hierarchical navbar. </h2>
        <h2>Our inspiration of design (when brainstorming) comes from Slack, Notion, Trello, Cloze, and Facebook Workplace.</h2>
        <br>
        <h2 style="font-weight: bolder;"><u>Mockup Crit in Studio</u></h2>
        <h2>Gianna Giancarlo (Brown CS alum, VP Experience Strategy at Hero Digital)</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>Users normally have the impression of the layout of the app on first sight, so it was rather surprising that our homepage’s navbar looks a bit different from the navbar in the other pages. In order to keep up with visual consistency, it is suggested that we keep the homepage navbar layout roughly the same as all other pages to increase learnability.</li><br>
        <li>On the homepage, the information in each card was pretty messy in the first place, sometimes with the same font size highlighting different information (e.g. name and event both have larger font size but it’s hard to tell the emphasis when highlights are inconsistent). To improve upon that, having the same level of information having the same font size can help with users processing information more quickly. Icons could be useful in building categories, but sometimes text hierarchy, if meticulously designed, can achieve the same effect.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Feedback from students</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Make it clearer what are clickable and what are not (e.g. navbar)</li>
          <li>Add buttons or icons for direct tutorial (increase learnability, since it is said that the app has a lot of functions and might be a bit hard for beginners to learn.</li>
          <li>Make company announcements on the homepage impermanent</li>
          <li>Improve color contrast (e.g. add shadow/outline) in planning page to serve a wide range of users (increase accessibility)
          </li>
        </ul>

	          		<p>Some users could identify the prototype as a platform that is designed for a company-wide dashboard, which is consistent with our design idea. Besides, they provided some compliments on the well organized layout and structure, reminding us on the right track. Since not everyone of them were familiar with Slack, it is hard for them to identify the main purpose of the slack dashboard. </p>

	          		<p><b>Task Description: </b></p>
	          		<p> The major emphasis of the connection task is to both build new connections within the company, and at the same time keep track of existing connections. To achieve this goal, two subtasks are created so users can achieve the main goal of keeping connections organized. </p>
	          		<p>
					<u>Subtask 1: </u>The users are asked to build new connections through the searching functionality, find the software engineer L.R., and add her to existing connections. 
					</p>
					<p>
					<u>Subtask 2: </u>The users are asked to find out more information about the existing information of one of his/her connections through exploring the existing connection network. Specifically, users are expected to find Jose G. from the marketing department and check out his email address. 
					 </p>

	          		<p><b>Users’ reactions:</b> </p>
	          		<p><u>User testing: </u> Among the three users we tested, most of the users were able to find L.R. and add her to existing connections, and also find Jose.G to check out his email. To find L.R, most of the users clicked on the search bar and look for software engineer L.R., then adding her to the connection by clicking on the add icon with “Add to personal connections.” All users are able to find Jose through clicking on the Marketing bubble in the personal connections page and navigate to his email address. This result validates our intention of building the page in two parts so users can both find new connections and also manage existing connections. One user also said she liked the layout of the bubble personal connections.</p>
	          		<p>

					<u>Errors:</u> Some users were having some trouble finding the specific persons in the task in the first place. This error might be a result of not knowing which page is the person’s existing connections and where to find new connections. One of the users wasn’t able to find L.R. since she didn’t notice the search bar was clickable and kept on searching for L.R. in the personal connections. To improve upon this user error, we might consider adding text instructions within the search bar indicating that the search bar allows user to search for both new and existing connections; if the user is an existing connection, the page will direct the user to the profile like that of Jose, if the person searched for is new, the page will provide a holistic result page of all people that matches information in the search bar.
